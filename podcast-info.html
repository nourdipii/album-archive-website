    <p>Welcome to Album Archive, the podcast where three students with way too much free time and a love for music chat about just about everything related to music.

    <p> We are your hosts: Nour, Dahiana, and Mick. We pretend to be experts in the field, but really, we just love music and have strong opinions about it. </p>
        
    <p> In our podcast, we talk about the latest albums, charts, and music trends.</p> 
    <p>Whether we’re glazing that one 10/10 album or spending half an hour discussing how bad the new Kanye album was, we say what we think (with no filter). </p>
        
        Sometimes we agree with each other, but more often we don’t...
        
        <p>Does this sound like a podcast for you? Then tune in to Album Archive!
